# ‚å® Ladispad
Ladispad is a custom-made 11 key macropad with 2 rotary encoders designed for the simplicity and the ease of assembly to non technical users. 
Macropad are not a new thing. Browsing the internet will lead to to dozens of open-source macropads that let you print your own PCB and assemble it at home, but most of these macropads uses matrixes which will force you to solder diodes adding a little complexity to the process.

Ladispad uses a direct pin approach , that means you don't need to solder diodes. Additionally I managed to add 2 rotary encoders and a fully customizable OLED screen which can be omitted if you choose so.

Ladispad uses a Pro Micro as its main controller. Its very affordable and have many varients with different USB ports and sizes. I designed the PCB so it will be compatible which whatever you choose.

The macropad is QMK/Via and soon Vial compatible which will add to the ease of use in case you want to program your encoders on the fly without the need to flash the firmware everytime you do so.

Included even the SVG files for the acrylic cases I made for the pad. you can laser cut it using any of the online service providers you choose.

## üëç What make Ladispad unique: 

- Minimal  components needed to have a fully functional macropad.
- 2 Rotary encoders implemented with extra function with layer switching.
- Compatible with different Pro Micros sizes,
- Acrylic case cutout included.

## üìÉ Things you need to get the whole experience:

- Pro Micro. (micro USB, mini USB, USB-C).
- 9 cherry MX style switches.
- 2 Rotary Encoders (EC11)
